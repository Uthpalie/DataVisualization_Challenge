# DataVisualization_Challenge
This repository contains the work done on data visualization. The challenge required for reviewing and sorting the data related to a pharmaceutical drug test done on a group of mice over a period of time. As part of the challenge, it was necessary to identify duplicate data, remove duplicate data, create a cleaned dataframe and then do several calculations and plottings for visualizing the data.

## Notes:
For performing the box plot, plyplot bar and scatter plot tutor assistance was sought for code reviews and to get better clarity.
